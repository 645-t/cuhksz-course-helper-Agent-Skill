# Academic Formatting Standards for CUHKsz Course Helper

## Typography Rules

### Fonts
- MATH/STATS: Times New Roman for all prose and headings; Cambria Math for equations
- CS: Georgia or serif for headings; Arial/Helvetica for body text; Courier New for code
- Do NOT mix more than 2 font families per presentation

### Sizes (PowerPoint)
| Element | Size |
|---|---|
| Main slide title | 28pt |
| Section heading | 22pt |
| Body text | 14pt |
| Caption / footnote | 10pt |
| Footer text | 9pt |
| Math inline | 13pt |
| Code | 11pt |

### Line Spacing
- Body text: 1.2 to 1.5 line spacing
- Inside definition/theorem boxes: 1.3
- Code blocks: exactly 1.0 (monospace)

## Layout Standards

### Margins (all templates)
- Top (below title/header): 0.5 in
- Bottom (above footer): 0.4 in
- Left/Right: 0.75 in

### Footer (all templates)
Required on every non-title slide:
- Left: School name (e.g., "SSE, CUHK(SZ)" or "SDS, CUHK(SZ)")
- Center: Course code + lecture number (e.g., "MAT3007 | Lecture 1")
- Right: Slide number (e.g., "7 / 24")

### Title Slide (required elements)
1. University name or logo (top or center)
2. Course code and name
3. Lecture number and title
4. Instructor name and affiliation
5. Date (semester and week, or specific date)

## Mathematical Notation Standards

- Vectors: bold lowercase (e.g., **x**, **v**)
- Matrices: bold uppercase (e.g., **A**, **B**)
- Sets: calligraphic or blackboard bold (R, Z, N)
- Functions: italic (f, g, h)
- Defined terms: first occurrence in bold or with "Definition" box
- Equations displayed on their own line: centered, numbered if referenced
- Inline math: use parentheses (x + y) not brackets for readability in prose

## Academic Language Standards

- Use formal register; avoid colloquial phrasing
- Define all notation at first use
- Theorems and definitions: state precisely, avoid "usually" or "sometimes"
- Examples: always state what the example illustrates before showing it
- Proofs: state what is being proved in the first line; end with QED or square symbol

## Bilingual (Chinese/English) Guidelines

- If slide titles are in English, keep them in English (do not translate)
- If body text is Chinese, AI additions should also be Chinese
- Math notation is language-neutral; keep as-is
- Do not mix Chinese and English within a single sentence
- For course terms with established Chinese translations, use both on first occurrence:
  e.g., "最优解 (optimal solution)"

## Accessibility Guidelines

- Minimum contrast ratio: 4.5:1 for text on background
- Never use color as the sole differentiator (add shape/pattern if needed)
- Alt-text or caption for all non-decorative figures
- Font size never below 10pt for any visible text element
